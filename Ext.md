#Extension Objects




#Introduction 

   
Object extensions are a very powerful part of design pattern. Unfortunately there is a lot of confusion on some of the more basic set-up concepts.This document will explain about object extension to clarify that.


#Overview


For some abstractions it is difficult to anticipate their complete interface since different
clients can require a different view on the abstraction. Combining all the operations and
state that the different clients need into a single interface results in a bloated interface.
Such interfaces are difficult to maintain and understand. Moreover, a change to a client
specific part of an interface can affect other clients that use the same abstraction.
As an example consider compound document architectures like OLE 2 or OpenDoc. A
compound document is made of components like text, graphics, spreadsheets, or movies.
Therefore the key abstraction of a compound document is something like a Component.
To assemble components in various interesting ways there is a need for a common
interface. Let's assume that this interface is defined by an abstract class Component. This
interface provides operations to manage and arrange components in a document.
Now consider a spelling checker for a compound document. It requires an interface to
enumerate the words of components that store text. One solution would be to add this
interface to Component and have an empty implementation for components that have no
text. However, this interface is client specific and would contribute to a bloated
Component interface. It would be better if new or unforeseen interfaces could be added
separately. Each component should be able to provide an interface for the spelling
checker without having to extend the Component interface.
The idea of the Extension Objects pattern is to anticipate such extensions. It proposes to
package the spell checker interface in a separate object. Clients that want to use this
extended interface can query whether a component supports it.
ComponentExtension is the common base class for extensions. It provides only a minimal
interface used to manage the extension itself. For example, it provides an operation to
inform the extension that it is about to be deleted. The ComponentExtension subclass
TextAccessor defines the interface for accessing text that is used by the spell checker
client. Its operations are FirstWord, NextWord for enumerating the words and
ChangeWord to replace a misspelled word. To enable different implementations of the
spelling checker interface it is defined as an abstract class.

#Applicability
Use the Extension Objects pattern when:

  
• You need to support the addition of new or unforeseen interfaces to existing classes
and you don't want to impact clients that don't need this new interface.Extension Objects lets you keep related operations together by defining them in a separate class.

• A class representing a key abstraction plays different roles for different clients. The
number of roles the class can play should be open-ended. There is a need to preserve
the key abstraction itself. For example, a customer object is still a customer object
even if different subsystems view it differently.

• A class should be extensible with new behavior without subclassing from it.








#Participants

####• Subject (Component)  
Defines the identity of an abstraction. It declares the interface to query whether an 
object has a particular extension. In the simplest case an interface is identified by a
string.  
####• Extension (ComponentExtension)  
The base class for all extensions. It defines some support for managing extensions
themselves. Extension knows its owning subject.

####• ConcreteSubject (StandardTextComponent)  
Implement the GetExtension operation to return a corresponding extension object
when the client asks for it.
####• AbstractExtension (TextAccessor)
Declares the interface for a specific extension.
####• ConcreteExtension (StandardTextAccessor)
Implement the extension interface for a particular component. Store the state
associated with a specific extension


#Collaborations
• A client asks a Subject for a specific extension.  
• When the extension exists the Subject returns a corresponding extension object. The
client subsequently uses the extension object to access additional functionality.  
• If the Subject doesn't support an extension it returns nil to signal that it doesn't
supp



#Consequences
Some of the consequences and liabilities of the Extension Objects pattern are as follows:


1. Extension Objects facilitates adding interfaces. Adding a new interface to a subject is
simplified since this doesn't require any change to the existing subject interface.
Extension Objects provides this additional functionality while preserving the key
abstraction itself.  
2. No bloated class interfaces for key abstractions. A key abstraction doesn't become
polluted with operations that are specific for a client. This could also be achieved by
- 4 -
subclassing a key abstraction. That is, client specific operations are defined in
subclasses. However, this results in a class hierarchy that can be difficult to manage.
Inheritance is static and requires creating a new class for each additional
interface.
3. Support for modeling different roles of a key abstraction in different subsystems.
When an abstraction is used across subsystems it often play different roles. Each role
requires its own state and behavior. Extension Objects support this by modeling a role
with an extension object. By keeping the roles separate one subsystem doesn’t have to
know the roles used in other subsystems. The abstraction can be passed from one
subsystem to the other by passing around the subject.
4. Clients become more complex. An extended interface is more complicated to use
than one which is provided by the subject itself. A client has to query for the
interface and check whether it exists. This introduces additional tests and
control paths in your program.
5. Tension to abuse extensions for concepts that should be explicitly modeled. It is
important that extensions are only used for unanticipated extensions.
Otherwise the understandability of a system suffers



#Implementation


A Subject class would be declared like this in C++:


class Subject {  
public:  
 //...  
 virtual Extension* GetExtension(const char* name);  
};  
Subject::GetExtension is implemented as:  
Extension* Subject::GetExtension(const char* name)  
{  
 return 0;  
}  
Here is a ConcreteSubject that provides a SpecificExtension:  
class ConcreteSubject: public Subject {  
public:  
 //...
 virtual Extension* GetExtension(const char* name);  
private:  
 SpecificExtension* specificExtension;  
};
The implementation of ConcreteSubject::GetExtension is defined like:  
Extension* ConcreteSubject::GetExtension(const char* name)  
{  
 if (strcmp(name, "SpecificExtension" == 0) {  
 if (specificExtension == 0)  
 specificExtension = new SpecificExtension(this);  
- 5 -  
 return specificExtension;  
 }  
 return Subject::GetExtension(name);  
}  
Finally, to access an extension the client writes:  
SpecificExtension* extension;  
Subject* subject;  
extension = dynamic_cast<SpecificExtension*>(  
 subject->GetExtension("SpecificExtension")  
);  
if (extension) {  
 // use the extension interface  
}  

Before the extension can be used it has to be narrowed to a more specific type. In C++
this is achieved with the dynamic_cast operator.

#####Here are some implementation issues that arise when you apply Extension Object:

#####1. Internal vs. External extensions:
 A key issue is how the extensions are created and
managed. One solution is to store an extension object in an instance variable of the
ConcreteSubject. When the extension is requested it can be returned to the client. This
solution assumes that the ConcreteSubject knows its extensions and they are therefore
considered as internal. In this solution it is not possible to attach new extensions from
the outside. However, this implementation only adds a GetExtension accessor
operation and doesn’t require any state in Subject. As a consequence the cost of
adding support for extensions is small.

#####2.Identifying extensions:
Extensions need a unique way to identify them. A simple
approach is the use of strings. Strings require some infrastructure to avoid duplicates.
One way to enforce uniqueness in C++ is to use RTTI and the typeid operator to
uniquely identify an interface. In this case the GetExtension takes a type_info as a
parameter. To ask for a particular extension the client passes the type_info of the
AbstractExtension class. The typeid operator is used to retrieve a corresponding
type_info.


AbstractExtension* extension;
Subject* subject;  
extension = subject->GetExtension(typeid(AbstractExtension));  
Another language independent way to identify an interface is the use of an interface  
identifier mechanism.


#####3. Demand loading of extensions:
Subject defines a well defined access point to an
extension. As a consequence it becomes easy to dynamically load the implementation
of an extension when it is needed. The same is true for loading the persistent state
associated with an extension. It can be activated on demand once a client requests it.
A consequence of demand loading is a situation where an existing extension is
requested but its dynamic link library is missing. In this case one has to be careful to
preserve the persistent state of the extension object. Otherwise the state is lost and
cannot be retrieved when the library becomes available in the future.


#####4. Defining Abstract Extension: 
In C++ all members of AbstractExtension are declared
as pure virtuals. In Java an AbstractExtension is defined as an interface.

#####5. Freeing Extension Objects:
Another implementation issue in non garbage collected
environments is the freeing of extension objects. The Subject hands out a reference to
an extension object and therefore has no control over the lifetime of the extension.
One approach is to consider the extensions to be owned by the Subject and to destroy
them when the Subject is destroyed. An alternative is the use of reference counting.
Clients have to increment a reference count when they access an extension and to
decrement it once they are done with it.

#Known Uses
Support for extensible interfaces is common in Compound Document architectures. Both
OpenDoc and OLE provide a corresponding mechanism. In OpenDoc the common base
ODObject provides the interface for accessing extensions. OLE builds on top of the
Component Object Model (COM). In COM all interfaces of an object are accessed by the
QueryInterface mechanism.
In the user interface framework of Taligent’s CommonPoint the class TView is
responsible for managing a visual portion of screen real estate. TView is a key abstraction
of the graphical user interface framework. It can be extended with additional interfaces
and behaviour without subclassing. TView provides so called Attributes. An attribute can
be attached to a view and a client can query a view for a specific attribute. To extend a
view with additional behavior a client implements an Attribute subclass and attaches an
instance to a view. For example, a TNameAttribute can be used to attach an interface for
assigning a name to a view. TView uses the dictionary approach to manage the set of
extensions.

#Related Patterns
Visitor centralizes behavior and enables to add new behavior to a class hierarchy without
having to change it. Visitor has similar benefits as the Extension Objects pattern. In
contrast to Visitor the Extension Objects pattern doesn’t require a stable class hierarchy
and doesn’t introduce a dependency cycle.
Decorator is another pattern to extend the behaviour of an object. For the client the use of
decorated objects is more transparent than extension objects. Decorators work best in
situations when the interface is narrow and some existing operations should be
augmented.
Adapter supports to adapt an existing interface. The Extension Objects pattern supports
additional interfaces. Extension Objects and Adapter can work together in situations
where an object needs to be adapted to an extension interface.
